# Instead of returning hardcode HTML from the function,
 a HTML file can be rendered by the render_template() function.

 example

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
   return render_template(‘hello.html’)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run(debug = True)

# Flask will try to find the HTML file in the templates ,folder
in the same folder in which this script is present.



# from flask import request :
# it is used to check the request is post or get

# like,
if request.method == "post":
    pass
else
    pass
